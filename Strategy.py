        Method to set unit initializations. Run at the beginning of a game, after assigning player numbers.

        OUTPUT:
            An array of 3 dictionaries, where each dictionary details a unit. The dictionaries should have the following fields
                "health": An integer indicating the desired health for that unit
                "speed": An integer indicating the desired speed for that unit
                "unitId": An integer indicating the desired id for that unit. In this provided example, we assign Ids 1,2,3 if you are player1, or 4,5,6 if you are player2
                "attackPattern": a 7x7 2d integer list indicating the desired attack pattern for that unit
                "terrainPattern": a 7x7 2d boolean list indicating the desired terrain pattern for that unit.
        Note: terrainPattern and attackPattern should be indexed x,y. with (0,0) being the bottom left
        If player_id is 1, UnitIds for the bots should be 1,2,3. If player_id is 2, UnitIds should be 4,5,6
